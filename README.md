## Hello there, welcome to my GitHub!
(If you read that as Obi-Wan, you and I can be friends)! 

### I am a recently qualified âœ¨ Full Stack Software Developer âœ¨ with a passion for continuous learning. My studies led me to a newfound love of software and web development. 

### ðŸŒ± Always Learning...
I'm constantly practicing the skills that I have learnt so far, whilst also expanding my knowledge by beginning to delve into the world of Python (by completing Udemy courses).

### ðŸ“Š Working On...
I'm currently working on various projects: including my personal project called Exercise Engine (repo is training-programs) - a workout generator! 
As well as this, I am working on re-creating a lot of coding challenges that I completed during my studies in order for them to appear public.
