## Hello there!
(If you read that as Obi-Wan, you and I can be friends)! 

### ðŸ“š Qualifications and Certifications
- Level 6 Certificate in Applied Software Development
- Datacom - Software Development Job Simulation Certificate


### I am a recently qualified âœ¨ Full Stack Software Developer âœ¨ with a passion for continuous learning. My studies led me to a newfound love of software and web development. 

### ðŸŒ± Always Learning...
I'm constantly practicing the skills that I have learnt so far, whilst also expanding my knowledge by beginning to delve into the world of Python (by completing Udemy courses).

### ðŸ“Š Working On...
I'm currently working on some small projects (between learning), including building a website for a friend of mine who has their own business. While it's not finished yet, I'm having fun [creating it](https://github.com/jess-bay/sea-akl-front-end-only).

As well as this, I am working on re-creating a lot of coding challenges that I completed during my studies in order for them to appear public.
